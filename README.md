# VeryHotKeys

Windows' app for creating shortcuts.

## Installing

First of all, if you want to **customize** a code, you can clone it by Git
```
git clone https://github.com/Shogaan/VeryHotKeys.git
```

You need to have installed python3.6. Then in project's folder open cmd(**I REALLY recommend to use Windows**). Create virtualenv by
```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
```
Then activate it by `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` and, finally, install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To launch the app you need to have activated venv and in cmd type `python main.py`

Second way is using exe-files:

#### Portable version

```

#### Installation version

```
